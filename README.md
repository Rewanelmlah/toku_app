# language_learning_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The toku application is a simple application for learning the Japanese language,
which contains five main screens, the first of which categories can be moved to the different pages.
The first category is numbers and the second category of family members.
The third category is colours, and the fourth category is phrases within each element. 
There is a picture of it, the name in English language, the name is in Japanese, and an icon to play the sound that speaks the word in Japanese.
